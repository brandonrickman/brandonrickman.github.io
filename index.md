### Professional Self-Assessment

#### Introduction

Working on this capstone has directed all of my knowledge and skills that I have acquired over the course of my education in the computer science program. I started out working towards a goal of developing an immersive training system built with artificial intelligence and virtual reality. However, that morphed into a love for cybersecurity, digital forensics, hacking, and cryptology. Given the limited amount of time I chose these artifacts to enhance due to their exposure and key developmental time points in my educational program. Working on them again, I realize how much I have grown in my understanding of the language, but more importantly the concepts behind each language.
	
#### Collaborating in a Team

Team collaboration is a key to software development. Programs and their functions are complex and detailed. Being able to assist and have people assist you in development of your program can lead to great achievements. In the capstone we did not work as a team, however, we used code review techniques to showcase our purposed enhancements and artifact selections. Code review can point out logic flaws or mis-links in functionality. Reviewing other’s code can teach you new code syntax, naming conventions, and algorithms.
	
#### Communicating to Stakeholders

Communication, whether verbal or written, is the sign of an effective professional. Being able to convey complex topics to stakeholders can be challenging but effective ways to ensure confidence, develop relationships, and secure funding for future projects. Stakeholders can be co-workers as well. Being able to explain or discussion your ideas will help shape the project and can make you an effective leader in your organization.
	
#### Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are used to instruct a computer on how to process data. The functionality behind every program is an algorithm. Understanding how to build these processes is fundamental to becoming a professional in the computer science world. Learning when and how to use concepts like for-loops, while loops, and conditional statements can make you an effective computer science professional.
	
#### Security

Security is the on the forefront of business’ and client’s mindset. Personnel data is stolen and used everyday across the world and the security of a client’s data is the responsibility of the business. Security must maintain the CIA triad on all data, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This means that only those who are authorized to access the data do. The data must be protected from modification without proper access. The data must be available to those authorized to access it. Privacy and security come together, and the user must be able to have full control of their data even when maintained by the business. 
	
#### Summary of Skills and Artifacts

Each of these artifacts exhibit key foundational areas of computer science and my ability to modify and understand their concepts. The languages and algorithms developed inside these artifacts build on each other if they were encompassed into one program, but additionally showcase how each can be held separately. The experience developed in this capstone and the computer science program will help prepare me for a professional career in the computer science profession.
